This restriction tries to solve the problem of the shared state: multiple programes can modify the same data at once, enabling all sorts of buggs. Also, this makes it harder to modify the code: if, say, the type of a variable changes, you have to remember to change every single function that depended on the data type of that variable.\n",

    "ing something over and over from scratch, why don’t we reuse existing code in new projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea looks great on paper, but it turns out that making existing code work in a new context usually takes extra effort. Tight coupling between components, dependencies on concrete classes instead of interfaces, hardcoded operations—all of this reduces flexibility of the code and makes it harder to reuse it.\n",

    "Using design patterns is one way to increase flexibility of software components and make them easier to reuse. However, this sometimes comes at the price of making the components more complicated.\n",

This restriction tries to solve the problem of the shared state: multiple programes can modify the same data at once, enabling all sorts of buggs.

    "#### 1. Code Reuse\n",
    "Code reuse is one of the most common ways to reduce development costs. The intent is pretty obvious: instead of develop-\n",
    "ing something over and over from scratch, why don’t we reuse existing code in new projects?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea looks great on paper, but it turns out that making existing code work in a new context usually takes extra effort. Tight coupling between components, dependencies on concrete classes instead of interfaces, hardcoded operations—all of this reduces flexibility of the code and makes it harder to reuse it.\n",

    "Using design patterns is one way to increase flexibility of software components and make them easier to reuse. However, this sometimes comes at the price of making the components more complicated.\n",

    "- **A subclass can’t reduce the interface of the superclass:** You have to implement all abstract methods of the parent class even if you won’t be using them.\n",
    "- **When overriding methods you need to make sure that the new behavior is compatible with the base one.**\n",
    "- **Inheritance breaks encapsulation of the superclass:** Internal details of the parent class become available to the subclass.\n",
    "- **Subclasses are tightly coupled to superclasses:** Any change in a superclass may break the functionality of subclasses.\n",
    "- **Trying to reuse code through inheritance can lead to creating parallel inheritance hierarchies:** Inheritance usually takes place in a single dimension. But whenever there are two or more dimensions, you have to create lots of class combinations, bloating the class hierarchy to a ridiculous size.\n",

    "Robert Martin introduced them in the book *Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Single Responsibility Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> A class should have just one reason to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to make every class responsible for a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and make that responsibility entirely encapsulated by (you can also say *hidden within*) the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open/Closed Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is *open if you can extend it*, produce a subclass and do whatever you want with it—add new methods or fields, override base behavior, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the class is *closed* (you can also say *complete*) if it’s 100% ready to be used by other classes — its *interface is clearly defined and won’t be changed* in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Liskov Substitution Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> When extending a class, remember that you should be able to pass objects of the subclass in place of objects of the parent class without breaking the client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other design principles which are wide open for interpretation, the substitution principle has a set of formal requirements for subclasses, and specifically for their methods. Let’s go over this checklist in detail.\n",
    "- Parameter types in a method of a subclass should match or be more abstract than parameter types in the method of the superclass.\n",
    "- The return type in a method of a subclass should match or be a subtype of the return type in the method of the superclass.\n",
    "- A method in a subclass shouldn’t throw types of exceptions which the base method isn’t expected to throw.\n",
    "- A subclass shouldn’t strengthen pre-conditions.\n",
    "- A subclass shouldn’t weaken post-conditions.\n",
    "- Invariants of a superclass must be preserved. (Invariants are conditions in which an object makes sense.)\n",
    "- A subclass shouldn’t change values of private fields of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: now this principle is usually built into languages, but I think SmallTalk didn't abide by it for instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interface Segregation Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> Clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to make your interfaces narrow enough that client classes don’t have to implement behaviors they don’t need.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the interface segregation principle, you should break down “fat” interfaces into more granular and specific ones. Clients should implement only those methods that they really need. Otherwise, a change to a “fat” interface would break even clients that don’t use the changed methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependency Inversion Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "> High-level classes shouldn’t depend on low-level classes. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions shouldn’t depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, insert dependencies into a level as high as possible.\n",
